# neural-network-from-scratch
Define the Neural Network Class:

Create a class NeuralNetwork in network.py.
Define methods for initialization, forward pass, and backward pass.
'''
Implement Activation Functions in utils.py:
'''
Sigmoid
ReLU
Tanh
Softmax
'''
Implement Loss Functions in utils.py:
'''
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Cross-Entropy Loss
Implement the Forward Pass:

Define the forward pass method in your NeuralNetwork class.
Implement the Backward Pass (Backpropagation):

Define the backward pass method in your NeuralNetwork class.
'''
Training the Neural Network
'''
Create a Training Loop in main.py:

Load and preprocess your dataset.
Initialize the neural network.
Implement the training loop.
Print training progress.
Evaluate the Neural Network:

Implement an evaluation method to test the network on a validation dataset.
